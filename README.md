### Overview of the Analysis
In this project we will analyze bikeshare data from CitiBike in New York City for presentation to investors looking to begin a bikeshare program in Des Moines, Iowa. Here are some of the questions that need answering:

- 1.1 Who uses bikeshare programs?
- 2.1 What area of a city sees the most bikeshare usage?
- 3.1 What time of day are bikes used the most and the least used?
- 4.1 How much are the bikes used and by whom?

#### Customer Information
Below we can see information regarding our target demographic with a pie chart, and also a line graph showing Usage by Gender. This can help provide insight, on how to better target the right market and crowd for the most efficient increase in revenue. As we can see that a high percentage of males use this service compare to females, so it will be wise to place these bikes in areas with a higher male population.

In this image we can see a more deeper dive into or target demograph. It allows us to understand that yes males use the service more, but it also shows which day of the week is the service being used the most. It also shows that, our subcribers have more of a higher use ratio compare to non-subscribing customers.

#### Popular Cities for Program
Below we can see information regarding geographical areas of high interest. This can help provide insight, on how to better target the right market and crowd for the most efficient increase in revenue. As we can see that there is high usaage in areas where there is alot of foot traffic or where the use of a automobile isnt the most pleasent, aka downtown. So it will be ideal to target areas where most people have to comute on foot and where the addition of this service will provide an added benefit to individuals.

#### Rides Per Hour of Day 
Below we can see two images that help us give information regarding our use of bikes. 

The first visualization can help provide insight, on when the use of bikes is highest and lowest, and it can help us determine when we can do bike repairs. From our analysis we can conclude that, our lowest operation time is between 2am - 5am, which would be a perfect time for repairs and maintenance work.

The second visualization can help us understand when to have the bikes stocked for to support the demand for the bikes. For example, in our example below, we can see and visualize that the times of highest use or traffic is Monday - Friday and at times from 8am - 9am (which is the time most people are goint to work). The second busiest time is between 5pm to 7pm (which is again when people are finishing work and going home).

#### Bike Usage and Maintenance Visualization

### Summary
In conclusion, bikeshare services are very popular in busy areas, areas with a high tourist attraactions, where occupied real estate is densely packed and parking spaces may be scarce and also where automobile transportation isnt ideal. The user base is made up mostly of male subscribers, providing regular income to the program. Focus should be put towards making sure there is enough bike supply during peek hours.
